        <header><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3></header>
        <details>
            <summary role="button">What is Flock Safety?</summary>
            <p>Flock Safety is a private technology company that provides Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs) and other surveillance equipment to law enforcement and private entities. ALPRs are cameras that continuously capture, process, and interpret the license plates, vehicle images, and locations of every car that drives past them.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary role="button">How is Champaign using Flock equipment?</summary>
            <p>The City of Champaign recently approved a five-year, $1,154,200 contract with Flock to expand its surveillance network to include 62 fixed cameras, 4 mobile units, and 18 intersection "Public Safety Camera" systems throughout the city.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary role="button">Why did Champaign purchase ALPRs?</summary>
            <p>The primary justification for bringing ALPRs to Champaign was to reduce gun violence. Following the summer of 2021, Champaign (like nearly every similar-sized municipality in the United States), experienced an historic rise in gun violence. ALPRs were purchased as part of a “Community Gun Violence Prevention Blueprint” among other strategies.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary role="button">Are Flock Safety ALPRs effective at combatting gun violence in Champaign?</summary>
            <p>No. While the primary justification for bringing ALPRs to Champaign was to reduce gun violence, independent analyses show the technology is rarely used for that purpose. An audit of 54 crimes "solved" using ALPRs in Champaign during its first nine months revealed that only 26% were gun-related felonies. The vast majority of the time, the cameras were used for minor offenses, non-gun felonies (like stolen vehicles), or non-criminal incidents. Furthermore, while Champaign saw a drop in shootings after 2021, the neighboring city of Urbana—which refused to deploy ALPRs—saw a massive 62.7% drop in shootings during the exact same period, proving that expensive surveillance networks are not the only, or even the primary, driver of violent crime reduction.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary role="button">How much do Flock cameras cost Champaign taxpayers?</summary>
            <p>Champaign is spending over $1.15 million on the current Flock Safety contract, or over $228,000 annually.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary role="button">How could this money be better spent to address gun violence?</summary>
            <p>This money would be far better spent addressing the root causes of crime by investing in historically underprivileged neighborhoods. For example, the city has previously allocated funds toward community violence reduction programs, reentry support, and neighborhood revitalization, and could bolster these effective efforts. Relying on Flock represents a reactionary choice to increase the police state rather than investing in basic community needs like infrastructure, social safety nets, and community trust.</p>
        </details>
		<details>
            <summary role="button">Who does Flock Safety share data with?</summary>
            <p>While Flock Safety and local police often claim that data sharing is strictly a "local decision," the reality of Flock’s sprawling, interconnected network tells a different story. Officially, Champaign Police have shared access to their ALPR data with dozens of other departments, ranging from local campus police to the Illinois State Police, and even out-of-state agencies like the Chesterfield County Police Department in Virginia.</p>
            <p>However, the sharing goes much deeper than local agreements. Flock’s standard contracts often grant the company a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, reproduce, and distribute local agency data for broad "crime-prevention efforts". Furthermore, Flock integrates its database with the Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS)—a massive, federally-funded data-sharing network. Five of the six regional RISS centers have direct access to the Flock database, effectively acting as a backdoor that allows thousands of federal, state, and international agencies to access local data. Because of these overarching networks and features like "National Lookup," Illinois Flock data has already been improperly accessed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and an out-of-state Texas sheriff who was tracking a woman seeking an abortion.</p>        
		</details>
        <details>
            <summary role="button">In Illinois we have the TRUST Act, which prevents sharing Flock data with ICE, right?</summary>
            <p>In theory, yes, but in practice, no. While the Illinois TRUST Act legally prohibits local police from providing federal entities like ICE with direct access to local electronic databases for civil immigration enforcement, Flock Safety’s interconnected technology creates multiple loopholes, backdoors and sidedoors that effectively bypass these state protections.</p>
