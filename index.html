                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Kansas police chief used Flock to track his ex-girlfriend. He did not face any charges.
                        [<a href="https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article291059560.html">source</a>]

                    <li>
                        Georgia police chief charged with using license plate readers to stalk and harass people.
                        [<a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-plate-readers-stalk-harass-chief-arrested-39adb6f89fc2074da61f2801fef3f180">source</a>]

            <summary role="button">But Flock said they stopped sharing data with ICE.</summary>
            <p>
                They said they don't in July 2025 [<a href="https://archive.is/rxqsT">source</a>],
                but open records request showed that as of August 2025, ICE and CBP have indirect access even in some states where collaboration between police and ICE is illegal
                [<a href="https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2025/10/21/leaving-the-door-wide-open/">source</a>].
            </p>
            <p>
                The main problem is that there is no transparency on the data once it gets uploaded to Flock's private servers.
                They've lied before. Why should we trust them now?
